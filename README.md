# Facial-Debaising-with-VAE

Automated face recognition has achieved remarkable success with the rapid developments of deep learning algorithms. Despite the improvement in the accuracy of face recognition, one topic is of significance. Does a face recognition system perform equally well on different demographic groups? In fact, it has been observed that many face recognition systems have lower performance for certain demographic groups than others, Such face recognition systems are said to be biased in terms of demographics.

The concept of unbiased face recognition is that given a face recognition system, equal performances can be achieved in different categories of face images. Despite the research on pose-invariant face recognition that aims for equal performance on all poses, we believe that it is inappropriate to define variations like pose, illumination, or resolution, as the categories. These are instantaneous image-related variations with intrinsic bias. E.g., large pose or low resolution faces are inherently harder to be recognized.
